# tail_distribution
tail distribution analysis for backups
dom_sing_alpha contains the tail distribution analysis for different values of $\alpha$, the smallest restarting probability. For systems with no probabilistic restarts, this value is equal to 0

dom_sing_n contains the tail distribution analysis for increasing values of $n$. That is, how does the tail Prob(Age_{\nu}= n) evolve with increasing value of $n$.
